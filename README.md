# Data analysis exercises

I created this repository to store the exercises done during the FreeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python course.
The exercises explore many responsibilities of the data analysis area, such as obtaining data, cleaning, visualizing graphs, and raising and answering questions.

You can access the course for free through [this link.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)
